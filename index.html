  <h1>The Collective House Hack</h1>
  
  <h2>How activists and life hackers are living in luxury, for cheap, and how to do it.</h2>
  
  <h3>The 20th Anniversary</h3>
  
  <p>Walking in the room. there is a vast table running far across the long-side of the house. This house has nurtured across the years multiple generations span of intense creatives, and the many wonderous oddballs characters are 
    standing in every spot, every corners .</p>
  
  <p>The house is a 18th century farmhouse on the edge of a mid-sized city. It sits alongside a massive barn, out of which stretched a table worthy of any imagined medieval banquet.</p>
  
  <p>It was a feast the that took all afternoon, cooked as a collaborative effort from part-time chefs and other foodies that had worked their skills as a hobby or out of love. Then was an annual tradition: the talent show. Then the <a href="http://www.whatcheerbrigade.com/">18-piece marching band</a>, the dance party, and night swimming in the woods.</p>
  
  <p>I'd been going to this party for years, but this year was the 20th aniversary of the house, which gave the evening this extra fluorescence, and made folks chatty and retrospective. This year I heard the story of how it all started.</p>
  
      <p>The house sat alongside a cavernous multi-level barn, lined with tools of all manner, pieces of bicycles, mopeds and obscure larger vehicles, you name it. Frogs belched a pool it never made sense to maintain. Inside was food, warmth, and the most free and empowered group of young adults I'd ever met. Their rent? Neglible. Their time was their to travel the world, hone strange talents, and participate in local activism.</p>
    
  <p>Seemingly infinite time.</p>
  
<p>At some point in the 90s, a few freedom-seeking activists in Boston placed an ad in a few local zines, to buy a house and make it a homebase for revolutions. By the time I entered it as a high school senior, it'd been there for 8 years<p> 
  
  
  <p>The thing is, it worked. This is the story of how they did it, and how to take it to the next level.</p>
  
  <h3>Finding Houses</h3>
  
  <p>Nothing becomes a model until its second iteration. The most important chain restaurant isn't the first one, it's the second, since that's where it passes a crucial test: can we replicate it?</p>
  
  <p>In that sense, maybe the most important collective house in our city was not "The Gogo" but the collective house it inspired next, the one we started. The Gogo was always a bit far. So it got a circle of us thinking, what if something like this could exist near the city center? And we would call it "Distant Castle".</p>
  
  <p>When we started looking, The Gogo was a guide to what we were looking for. It had to be one big single family house. Apartment-style architecture would lead to apartment-style isolation. And it couldn't be in a wealthy neighborhood where house prices were inflated in a competition for status, or where fussy neighbors would feel threatened by our project and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hartford-connecticut-11-live-in-single-family-home-could-be-forced-out/">react politically</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Driving around the city gave us a quick sense of where they house we wanted were. So did searches on sites like <a href="http://trulia.com/">Trulia</a> searching by price and squarefootage.

    <h3>What you're looking for</h3>
    <p>To share a house with a bunch of people, you'll need to find a house that was built to do that, or can be modified to. Don't pick a place where the basic architecture of the house is working against you. Many 19th and early 20th century houses were built for large families and live-in servants. These work great.</p>

    ## the ladder of abstraction: house->neighborhood->patterns of neighborhoods-> 
    ##  --> stats across neighborhoods
    
    * what you are looking for (unintuitive stuff about houses)
      * not an partment
      * vertically
      * made for big, huge families
    
    * Step 1: find the sweet spots.
      * reconizing your current spot is fertile
      * identifying the cheap zone of the city where houses have not been subdivided
        and are still big
      * moving away from middle class wealth, materialistic culture neighborhoods.
      * finding residual economic depression
      
    * Step 2: one person finds a job that's the stable kind, hold it for two years
    * a city: need a city with depressed real estates values     
    * widget: real estate search
      * done on archived data
    * the money: strategy to build up the money
    * widget: the expodential power of a high saving rate.
    * 
    * the mortgage: income and strategies to build up the credit
    * the crew: facebook like widget / maybe a way to say "i'm interested" and post on the site for strangers, with a map. 
    * the meetings: internal process of the house
    * the chores: ? 
    * refinements: (equity agreement? what happens when you own the house?)
